# The Coupling Clinic — Lab 5, Part D

> Week 3 was about refusing a pattern. Week 4 was about telling three similar patterns apart.
> **Week 5 is about coupling** — and both of this week's patterns exist to reduce it, in two
> completely different directions.

## D1 — The arithmetic, BEFORE you write any code · 8 pts

**Do this section first.** It takes ten minutes and it decides whether the rest of the week
makes sense to you.

DungeonForge has **15 monster species**. We want **4 combat behaviours**: aggressive, ranged,
skittish, healer.

### The subclassing approach

Suppose behaviour is expressed by subclassing `Monster` — `AggressiveSkeleton`,
`SkittishSkeleton`, `RangedImp`, and so on.



| Question | Your answer |
|---|---|
| How many classes for 15 species × 4 behaviours? | 60 classes (15 × 4) |
| Add a 5th behaviour (say, "berserk"). How many NEW classes? | 15 new classes |
| Add a 16th species. How many NEW classes? | 4 new classes |
| A skeleton is losing badly and should start running. **Can a `SkittishSkeleton` object become an `AggressiveSkeleton` object at runtime?** Answer yes or no and say why. | No — an object's class is fixed once created; you'd have to destroy and replace it, losing identity. |

### The composition approach

| Question | Your answer 
|---|---|
| How many classes for 15 species + 4 strategies? | 5 classes (1 Monster class + 4 strategy classes; species are just data, not classes) |
| Add a 5th behaviour. How many NEW classes? | 1 new class |
| Add a 16th species. How many NEW **Java** files? | 0 new Java files |
| Can a monster change behaviour at runtime? How? | Yes — call monster.setStrategy(new SomeStrategy()) |

**Now write two or three sentences.** Head First calls this the SimUDuck problem. In your own
words: **what is the actual defect in the subclassing design?** Not "it's more classes" —
there's a deeper problem that the last row of each table points at.

The real defect isn't the class count — it's that behavior and identity are welded together.
Because "being skittish" and "being a skeleton" are baked into one class name, an object can
never stop being skittish without stopping being that exact object. This is the same problem
Head First's SimUDuck ducks have: quacking and flying were treated as part of *what a duck is*
instead of *what a duck can do*.


## D2 — The coupling experiment · 9 pts

The Observer pattern's claim is that **a publisher need never know its subscribers**. Measure
it.

**Commit your work first**, so `git diff --stat` means something.

**Add a fourth listener.** Something simple — a `StatisticsCollector` that counts events by
type, or a `DangerMeter` that notices when your HP drops below 25%. Subscribe it in `Main`.

| Question | Your answer |
|---|---|
| How many **new** files? | |
| Did `Combat.java` change? | |
| Did `EventBus.java` change? | |
| Did any existing listener change? | |
| Which files changed at all? | |

**Paste `git diff --stat`:**

```

```

### Then the question that matters

`Combat` could simply have called `questTracker.onMonsterKilled(monster)` directly. That's one
line, it's obvious, and it needs no `EventBus`, no `GameEvent`, and no `GameEventListener` —
**three fewer classes.**

**Write a paragraph.** What does the direct call cost you that the bus does not? Give a
*concrete* scenario — a change somebody might ask for — where the direct-call version forces
you to edit `Combat` and the bus version does not.

## D3 — The swap, demonstrated · 5 pts

**Run the game and find a line in the combat log like:**

```
Forge Golem changes tactics: aggressive -> skittish.
```

**Paste yours:**

```

```

**Now answer:** at the moment that line was printed, what changed about the `Forge Golem`
object? Be precise. Its class? Its fields? Its identity? What *specifically* is different
about it one instruction later?


**Then add a fifth strategy** of your own invention. How many existing files did you have to
modify, and which?


## D4 — One honest question · 3 pts

**A prompt, because this one is worth surfacing now:** `CombatStrategy` and Week 8's `State`
pattern have almost identical UML — an interface, several implementations, an object that
holds one and delegates to it.

**Without looking ahead, guess:** what could possibly distinguish them? You are not expected
to be right. You're expected to have a hypothesis on record before Week 8 tells you.

My guess: Strategy is chosen once by whoever creates the object (or occasionally swapped from
outside, like a player choosing a difficulty setting), and the object doesn't necessarily know
or care which strategy it's using. State, on the other hand, feels like it should be the object
*itself* deciding to transition between states based on its own internal condition — almost
like the state objects would trigger their own replacement rather than something external
swapping them in.

**And anything else that's still unclear:**

I'm not fully sure yet whether Strategy objects are expected to be stateless/reusable across
many contexts, while State objects are expected to be tied to one specific object's lifecycle.
