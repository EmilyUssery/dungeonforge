/**
 * WEEK 3 -- SINGLETON.  (US-1.1)
 *
 * Exactly one settings source for the whole game. The PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR plus the STATIC
 * ACCESSOR is what enforces that; a public static field would only ask nicely.
 *
 * Why this deserves to be a Singleton -- the honest version:
 *   It is not "because settings are used everywhere." Lots of things are used everywhere and
 *   should still be passed as parameters. It is because a SECOND GameConfig would be a
 *   genuine bug: two parts of the game disagreeing about how much HP a player starts with is
 *   not a preference, it is a defect. The class enforces a rule that must not be broken.
 *
 * Honest cost, and you should be able to state it:
 *   This introduces global state. It makes testing harder -- see resetForTests() below,
 *   which exists ONLY because the pattern made the class hard to test. That method is a
 *   smell, and it is the price of the pattern.
 *
 * This project permits exactly TWO singletons: this one and RandomSource. If you can pass a
 * thing in as a parameter, it is not a Singleton -- it is a dependency.
