/**
 * WEEK 5 -- a minimal encounter resolver. New this week so that monsters have something to
 * DO. Week 7 turns player actions into Command objects and Week 10 replaces this loop with a
 * Template Method, so do not polish it -- it is scaffolding.
 *
 * TODO(week 5, US-3.1): look at monsterActs(). Every monster in the game fights the same way,
 * because "how a monster fights" is an if/else chain living inside this class. A Skeleton and
 * an Imp are indistinguishable in a fight.
 *
 * The obvious fix is to subclass Monster -- AggressiveMonster, RangedMonster, SkittishMonster.
 * Before you do that, count: we have 15 species and we want 4 behaviours. Do the arithmetic
 * in docs/strategy-observer-clinic.md Part D1 BEFORE you write any code.
 *
 * TODO(week 5, US-3.3): look at everything this class prints, and at the xp/gold bookkeeping.
 * Combat knows about the console. If we want quests, achievements or a scrolling log, they
 * all have to be bolted into this class, and it grows forever.
