 * WEEK 2 -- THE WALKING SKELETON.
 *
 * This program does almost nothing, and that is the entire point.
 *
 * A walking skeleton is the smallest thing that exercises your whole pipeline:
 * source -> compile -> test -> CI -> merge -> tag. When this runs green, you know
 * the MACHINE works. Every failure after today is your code, not your setup.
 *
 * From Week 3 this file grows into the real game. Do not delete it.
